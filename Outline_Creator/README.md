- [ ] Uses PubLayNet: https://github.com/hpanwar08/detectron2 - *no spoon-feeding*<br>
- [ ] LayoutLM model: https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutlm<br>
- [X] PubLayNet: https://github.com/phamquiluan/PubLayNet - *model loading*<br>
- [ ] **_DocBank_**: https://github.com/doc-analysis/DocBank - *trained model issue in pytorch*<br>
