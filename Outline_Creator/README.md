## Trials: 
>Finally found some DL based Document Layout Analysis, most of them are image_based. Only one is text_based: <br>

- :negative_squared_cross_mark: Python package: https://github.com/Layout-Parser/layout-parser - *didn't segment titles in the examples*<br>
- :white_large_square: Uses PubLayNet: https://github.com/hpanwar08/detectron2 - *no spoon-feeding*<br>
- :black_large_square: LayoutLM model: https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutlm<br>
- :white_check_mark: PubLayNet: https://github.com/phamquiluan/PubLayNet - *model loading*<br>
  - :fast_forward: The result of its implementation: [https://github.com/harshitaggarwal01/IntraMIC/blob/master/Outline_Creator/ieee-research-paper.png]()
- :white_large_square: **_DocBank_**: https://github.com/doc-analysis/DocBank - *trained model issue in pytorch*<br>
